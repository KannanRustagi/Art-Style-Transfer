Style transfer algorithms in the context of art try to capture the general style of an artist or an image and apply it to one or many content pictures. This is essentially an unpaired image to image translation task. Traditional style transfer
methods necessitate paired datasets, constraining the range of applicable
artistic styles. CycleGAN offers a solution by enabling unsupervised learning,
thus eliminating the requirement for paired examples and expanding the
scope of accessible artistic transformations
